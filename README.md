# TI-84 programs

I believe that the first programming I ever did was on my TI-84
calculator in high school. I went quite a ways past the usual programs
for computing the quadratic formula and such, and implemented such
applications as a chemical equation balancer (using matrix operations,
complete with string parsing and formatting), a solver for arbitrary
law-of-sines and law-of-cosines problems (complete with reporting on
the number of possible solutions), and step-by-step matrix
transformation algorithms for row-echelon form and LU decomposition.

Unfortunately, the chemical equation balancer met a tragic end when I
dropped my calculator in the laundry room and it reset the RAM.
Everything else was backed up. You will always be remembered,
BALANCEQ.
